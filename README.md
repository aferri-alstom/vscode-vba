## Changelog

- Added snippet for add a variable with custom type.


## Syntax Highlighting

This package provides syntax highlighting and snippets for visual basic.

All are based on an import of the [VBScript.tmLanguage](https://github.com/SublimeText/VBScript/blob/master/VBScript.tmLanguage)
file from the [Sublime Text VBScript](https://github.com/SublimeText/VBScript) repository.


## Snippets

### Basic code
- Variables declaration (ex. **dim var_name as boolean**)
- Variables declaration with inline instantiation
- Operators (if, else, for ecc)
- Subroutine/Function declaration with or without error handling

## Usage

Start typing what you want to insert and suggestion should raise:

### Variables declaration

Type the variable type:

```vb
dim var_name as boolean  ' by typing bool
dim var_name as integer  ' by typing int
dim var_name as string   ' by typing string

dim var_name as type     ' by typing type
```

For private or public declaration type **p** or **pu** before the type:

```vb
private var_name as boolean  ' by typing pbool
public var_name as boolean   ' by typing pubool

private var_name as integer  ' by typing pint
public var_name as integer   ' by typing puint

private var_name as type     ' by typing ptype
public var_name as type      ' by typing putype
```

For declaration with inline assignment type **a** before the type:

```vb
dim var_name as boolean: var_name = value  ' by typing abool
dim var_name as integer: var_name = value  ' by typing aint

dim var_name as type: var_name = value     ' by typing atype
```

### Subroutine and functions

Type **sub** or **func** for a standard private method:

```vb
' by typing sub
private sub sub_name()
end sub

' by typing func
private function function_name()
end function
```

For public prepend **p**:

```vb
' by typing psub
public sub sub_name()
    ' Add something here
end sub

' by typing pfunc
public function function_name() as boolean  ' Return type will be asked when inserting the snippet
    ' Add something here
    function_name = true
end function
```

For method with try-catch add **e** at the end:

```vb
' by typing sube
private sub sub_name()
    on error goto ErrorHandler

    ' Add something here

    on error goto 0
    exit sub
ErrorHandler:
    ' Handle the exception
end sub

' by typing pfunce ('p' for public, 'func' for function, and 'e' for add error handling)
public function function_name() as boolean  ' Return type will be asked when inserting the snippet
    on error goto ErrorHandler

    ' Add something here
    function_name = true

    on error goto 0
    exit function
ErrorHandler:
    ' Handle the exception
end function
```

### Utilities

Insert a file header (XCode style):

```vb
' by typing header
'
' file_name
' current_path
'
' Created by author on current_date.
' Modified by contributor on current_date.
' Copyright Â© company 2019. All rights reserved.
'
```
- file_name: automatically inserted.
- current_path: automatically inserted.
- current_date: automatically inserted, only creation date is asked if you need to change it.

Print to output console:

```vb
' by typing print
debug.print var_name

' by typing prints
debug.print "string"
```
